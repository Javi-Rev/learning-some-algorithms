**Learning Algorithms**
===================

Decided to spend Friday night like a bawss, so we're going to learn some basic algorithms and see if we can implement them in Ruby this weekend.  No big expectations - let's just have a little fun.

**Reference text for figuring out the basics:** [Introduction to Algorithms]

## **Weekend Goals**
>- Insertion Sort
- Divide and Conquer

### **Todos**
>- Write tests
- Add more algorithms
